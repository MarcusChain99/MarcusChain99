# About Me
Hello, and welcome to my github repository! This page is primary used as a source for my portfolio.
I'm a software developer fresh out of college! Currently working for a software development company 
that builds systems on a web based business tool called [Zoho](https://www.zoho.com/). I primarily write
code in [deluge](https://www.zoho.com/deluge/), but occasionally php, xml, and HTML/CSS.

Aside from my occupasion. I have experience writing code in [Java](https://www.java.com/en/), [Python](https://www.python.org/),
[C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/), [JS](https://www.javascript.com/) and more!

Occasionally, when i have free time, I'll be working on personal project that you can find here as well.
These projects can range from simple macros to full game projects. No limits there

Below are sections for personal projects and works I've done that you'd probably be more interested in as a potentional hirer.
